# Two-dimensional EPR (0.4.0)

Use the existing Open Data control for 1D and 2D files. Each recognized 2D dataset creates an independent subplot. Its 2D details section opens automatically. Supported formats: CIQTEK transient and field-power EPR; BES3T DSC/DTA, with XGF/YGF for IGD axes. Multiple 1D and 2D datasets may be selected together.

The 2D section controls heatmap/stack view, real/imaginary/magnitude, axis swap, X/Y limits, projection mean/sum/RMS, projection visibility, stack interval and offset. Projection CSV is available there. Default X projection is a sample mean over selected Y; Y projection is sample RMS over selected X, following the MATLAB reference. These are not coordinate-weighted integrals. RMS discards the sign.

No cell-count restriction is imposed. Preview renders to canvas pixels with nearest-cell selection using physical axis coordinates, including nonuniform coordinates. Every selected data point contributes to projections and color bounds. Preview resampling never modifies raw arrays. Large vector SVG/PDF exports preserve cells and may produce large files and take substantial time. Other image exports use canvas rendering. Actual capacity depends on browser memory and file size.

CIQTEK transient time is ns and field is G. The viewer swaps time-first data to field-horizontal by default. Field-power attenuation comes from params.power in dB, with no guessed coordinates. Unknown BES3T axis units remain as supplied.

Save Project includes matrices and 2D settings in SpinPlot project format 11. Older 1D project versions 9 and 10 remain readable. Clear config restores default 2D settings while retaining data. The 2D fold state is stored in config. Wheel zoom, Shift X pan, Ctrl Y pan use 2D bounds. Double click fits both 2D axes. One-dimensional noise selection and ΔB marking do not operate on 2D maps.

Validation: npm run build; node src/twod/core.test.js; node src/twod/large.test.js. Synthetic tests cover 1,002,000 cells, full mean/RMS projections, caching, pixel-based preview and matrix restoration; axis transpose and endian decoding. Real instrument files and full browser interaction still require validation.
