# Two-dimensional EPR (0.4.0)

Use the existing Open Data control for 1D and 2D files. Each recognized 2D dataset creates an independent subplot. Its 2D details section opens automatically. Supported formats: CIQTEK transient and field-power EPR; BES3T DSC/DTA, with XGF/YGF for IGD axes. Multiple 1D and 2D datasets may be selected together.

The 2D section controls heatmap/stack view, real/imaginary/magnitude, axis swap, X/Y limits, projection mean/sum/RMS, projection visibility, stack interval and offset. Projection CSV is available there. Default X projection is a sample mean over selected Y; Y projection is sample RMS over selected X, following the MATLAB reference. These are not coordinate-weighted integrals. RMS discards the sign.

No cell-count restriction is imposed. Preview renders to canvas pixels with nearest-cell selection using physical axis coordinates, including nonuniform coordinates. Every selected data point contributes to projections and color bounds. Preview resampling never modifies raw arrays. Large vector SVG/PDF exports preserve cells and may produce large files and take substantial time. Other image exports use canvas rendering. Actual capacity depends on browser memory and file size.

CIQTEK transient time is ns and field is G. The viewer swaps time-first data to field-horizontal by default. Field-power attenuation comes from params.power in dB, with no guessed coordinates. Unknown BES3T axis units remain as supplied.

Save Project includes matrices and 2D settings in SpinPlot project format 11. Older 1D project versions 9 and 10 remain readable. Clear config restores default 2D settings while retaining data. The 2D fold state is stored in config. Wheel zoom, Shift X pan, Ctrl Y pan use 2D bounds. Double click fits both 2D axes. One-dimensional noise selection and ΔB marking do not operate on 2D maps.

Validation: npm run build; node src/twod/core.test.js; node src/twod/large.test.js. Synthetic tests cover 1,002,000 cells, full mean/RMS projections, caching, pixel-based preview and matrix restoration; axis transpose and endian decoding. Real instrument files and full browser interaction still require validation.

## 0.5.0 layout and controls

Projection frames have coordinate ticks and intensity tick labels. Layout follows the uploaded MATLAB reference: X projection above the map, Y projection to the right, then colorbar. Projection X/Y selection ranges are stored separately from display X/Y bounds; labels are shown inside the projection plots by default and may be switched off. Colorbar min/max may be entered or adjusted with the wheel over the bar. Auto Z restores automatic min/max. All gradient palettes use the shared application palette registry.

The ordinary subplot panel remains visible. Subplot title, global font sizes and line width, frame/grid, axis overrides, Y tick/title visibility, annotations in acquisition coordinates, color override, layout and subplot ordering apply to 2D. Frequency alignment, g-axis conversion and 1D noise selection remain explicitly disabled for 2D; raw axes are preserved. Heatmap palette has a local selector, or may inherit any continuous subplot/global palette; categorical palettes fall back to turbo for the heatmap.

BES3T now shares one 1D/2D reader, including irregular XGF/YGF coordinates, REAL/CPLX interleaving, BIG/LIT byte order and C/S/I/F/D formats. Missing companions, wrong data lengths, incompatible real/imaginary formats, 3D and multichannel layouts are reported explicitly. No automatic acquisition-gain/scan/power normalization is performed. The uploaded private loaders identify future formats (Bruker ESP, JEOL, Magnettech, Adani and others); these are reference material only, not current supported formats.

Checks: node src/twod/bes3t.test.js additionally covers independent projection intervals, both endian sequences, descending/irregular axes, complex data, 1D irregular field axes and every continuous palette.
